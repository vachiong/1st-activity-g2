    <h1> Personal Information</h1>
    <p>I am Junnalyn D. Doning, 23 years old from Poblacion, Pinamungajan Cebu City.
      Since I am one of the chosen scholars of Passerelles Numeriques Philippines Organization,
      I am currently living at Nasipit Road Talamban Cebu City. My life as a scholar wasn't easy,
      but still I am thankful of the privilege that I have right now because through this scholarship
      program I can continue my studies in college and hopefully in God’s grace I will be able
      to receive a Certificate of Computer Technology.
    </p>
    <h1> Dreams</h1>
    <p>As a simple girl I also have simple dreams, first I want to give my family a simple house were they
      comfortable to sleep and safety to take a rest. I want to give my mother a small business like a
      sari-sari store and I want to provide all the wants and needs of my siblings.
    </p>
    <h1> Likes</h1>
    <p>I like nature, I like doing household chores, eating street foods, planting flowers and
      vegetables, taking good care of my siblings and other babies and lastly I like watching movies and vlogs.
      This is my way to relieve stress and forget the problems that I had been facing.</p>
    <h1> Dislikes</h1>
    <p>I don’t like to be surrounded with negative and attitude people, I don’t like if all lights at night are turned
      off. </p>
    <h1> Favorite Quotes</h1>
    <p>“Everything happen for a reason” “Basta magkugi,naay maani” </p>
